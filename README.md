# NIHCloudLab
NIH Cloud Lab is a resource developed by NIH’s CIT Cloud Services Team to support STRIDES’ mission of enabling and modernizing biomedical research through the cloud. Through this resource, NIH-funded researchers can become more efficient and comfortable in leveraging the cloud for their research purposes.

We offer Cloud Lab for each of the three big Cloud Service Providers, and we have a separate GitHub repository for each one. Visit these repositories for more information and collections of tutorials for [AWS](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabAWS), [Azure](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabAzure), and [Google Cloud](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabGCP).
